# Data-Analysis-of-Student-Exam-Scores
I recently analyzed student exam scores using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. This project allowed me to uncover insights into student performance and trends through visualizations and statistical analysis. I picked up his database from Kagal, if anyone needs it, he can go and pick it up from there
